# Code for my job 🎰

## Overview

My work involves providing the kindest and most empathetic service to users of a platform, so-called "where everything is played at random." Therefore, I often need tools that allow me to streamline my user interactions in the most efficient way. This repository will compile various problems, and I will solve them with software.

## Proposed code pieces (for now):

- Rollover calculator (Done...just a few details missing 🏁🤏)
  <br />
  A tool to calculate the bonus amount a user needs to wager before they can withdraw their bonus funds.

- Individual Metrics Visualizer: (For later...🏗️)
  <br />
  A tool to visualize individual user metrics, helping to identify patterns and improve user experience.
